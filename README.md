# DIABETES-PREDICTION

## Overview

This project predicts whether a patient is diabetic based on medical attributes such as glucose levels, BMI, and insulin using a Decision Tree Classifier. It demonstrates data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of the decision tree.

## Dataset

Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set

Features: Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Age

Target: Outcome (0 = non-diabetic, 1 = diabetic)

## Technologies

Python 3

pandas

scikit-learn

matplotlib / pydotplus (for tree visualization)

Google Colab

## Results

Achieved accuracy around ~70-80% (depends on random split)
